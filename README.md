# code-quiz

This homework assignment was to create a functional, multiple-choice quiz. It required a list of about 20 questions, a timer, start page, score count, a post-game screen, and play again option. The user would be prompted, and their answers would then be compared to a stored set of recorded answers. When completed, they would be shown their final score and be asked to input their initials to save that score on their local computer.
